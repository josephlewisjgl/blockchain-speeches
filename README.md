# blockchain-speeches

This project has been built to examplify the use of Blockchain in Python using Flask.

The original tutorial code uses proofs to link the chain however for security purposes my Blockchain uses a combination of proofs and hashes. The other adaptation is to use a different dataset. Instead of fictional currency data I have adapted the chain and API calls to use script data from Rick and Morty episodes. 

To initiate the Blockchain on one node, the main.py file can be run (if run on multiple ports many nodes can be made). The requests that can be made on the Blockchain are exemplified in the interaction.py file.

The code base is built with the help of the tutorial here: https://medium.com/@vanflymen/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46
