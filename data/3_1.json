    "script": "Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place.\nWow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen.\nOh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?\nDad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn't you like to go home?\nEmotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home.\nYeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is --\nJerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times.\nYou got it.\nSix folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect fucks didn't think I was worth your best equipment?\nMan, I told the money bugs. I said, \"You know who this guy is, right? You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer.\nWell, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.\nOh, I think you do. Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum.\nShoney's.\nOr the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.\nRelaxed enough?\nI admire you, Rick--\nWhen I--\nRick, here's--\nI tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth -- best thing that's ever happened to this family. I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don't know what I do.\nWho cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills.\nWell, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules.\nSummer, show your father some respect. He's pulling down a six-chewable figure income.\nI kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy.\nYou spoil us, Conroy.\nGrandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this!\nStop saying his name! He abandoned us.\nWillem Dafoe! Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning.\nDon't make my mistake, Summer. Don't deify the people that leave you. You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses  healthy forever.  Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself?\nMaybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!\nOoh!\nOh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?\n' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?\nIt's arousal. Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun.\nYeah, well, tough titties.\nWell, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.\nSomeone special you remember? Is that your memory of her out there -- between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper?\nIf we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories. If you take me where I want to go she'll be there, too, won't she?\nThe day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.\nOh, that sounds cool. I can get what I want and you can say goodbye.\nFine, but I'm driving.\nHuh? What are you -- What are you doing?\nGrandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door.\nSummer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad.\nWe're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!\nHey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now.\nBecause you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him.\nHe bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!\nYou're right!\nWhat?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer!\nOh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa!\nWhere are we going?\nTo the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.\nYeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film \"Mulan,\" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.\nRick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting.\nOkay. All right, all right.\nIs that--\nMe. I used to wear blue pants.\nWhen'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel?\nI didn't. I did.\nWhat?\nSummer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg.\nFine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself.\nAnd how are you gonna do that?\nI don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do.\nY-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-\nWhat is this place? And what's with \"Hunger Games\" Summer?\nThat's my sister. This used to be my home.\nSounds lonely.\nEh, pass.\nA different kind of Rick, I guess.\nSort of. I just took a long look at myself, and I don't think this science thing is gonna pay off.\nThat, Dianne, is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage.\nGood roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you're looking feral. I can't believe Rick did this.\nThese are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick \"I told ya so.\" So, uh--\nWhat are you doing with that?!\nNo! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?!\nHold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137.\nHe's in prison.\nSummer.\nHe got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him.\nBoo-yah!\nBoo-nah?\nCome on, girls! The ice cream's gonna melt.\nNooooooo!\nWow. This sauce is fucking amazing. You said it was promoting a movie?\nCarry the three, add a two. I got it. I fucking got it.\nWhoa. I-Is that it, the portal gun?\nYeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.\nAwesome-possum.  Mission Control, you getting this?\nYeah! Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Don't know, don't care. Pull me out.  Hey, pull me out! Can you hear me?\nNope, they cannot.\nWhy not?\nBecause the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.\nWhat are you talking about? This is a memory. Y-You can't alter details of a memory.\nTrue, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.\nIt's a trap! Abort! I'm still in his Shoney's! Repeat -- we never left his Shoney's!\nMission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.\nOkay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.\nIt's a trap! Abort! We never left his --   No!\nA city of Grandpas?\nIt's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.\nBut if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa?\nBecause Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.\nOperating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous Rick. How do you plead?\nHow is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.\nIt's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer. We just keep him here because he's fun. Look at him go.\nWe'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer?\nI say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick.\nMorty?\nWhat? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.\nLet's not suck the ghost of his dick too hard. He was a terrorist, and now he's dead.\nOh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!\nAll right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage. Obviously, I get her. You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty.\nGrandpa Rick!\nDuh!\nYou're alive!\nRick!\nMorty, take this. You're gonna need it later.\nThat's enough, Rick.\nWhat -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.\nThat's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.\nYou're a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them.\nI came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer.\nOh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing!\nR-Rick?\nWhy not shoot through her?\n20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.\nWhat the fuck?\nOr let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.\nBecause you love her!\nBecause it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.\nI hate you!\nNot an issue, sweetie.\nThat's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!\nMorty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.\nI'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!\nI wasn't gonna let her die, you fuckin' moron!\nHa!\nAww.\nThe point is he thought I was going to.\nI totally did, by the way. You're a fucking moron, Morty.\nMorty, you fucking idiot!\nYou're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand.\nWho's stupid now, bitch?!\nMorty, we just got him back!\nThat was amazing, Morty. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay, let's wrap this-\nGood job, Morty. Let's go, kids.\nWhat?! What happened?\nOldest Rick trick in the book.\n\"Fake gun, shoot me in standoff.\" Brilliant.\nHa, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note.\nCan't we just portal home?\nNot until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.\nEmployee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.\nSo, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?\nDestroying the  galactic government.\nAre you going to set all their nukes to target each other?\nOoh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?\nGood pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero.\nNo longer will the insects have domain over surface world!\nJerry, what the hell is happening?!\nThe galactic government collapsed.\nAre you okay?\nLook, I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, I'm glad you're okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father? Our children, our planet, our jobs? Is there anything left to lose?\nJust each other, and I'll never let you go. And I'm so sorry I ever did this to us.\nGuess who dismantled the government?\nPlease don't leave me again.\nI never will, baby.\nI was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan!\nJerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison.\nUm..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time.\nNo, you're right. Where's the vodka?\nBeth, it's him or me!\nSeems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage.\nWhat the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle.\nJerry's going to spend some time divorced.\nOh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.\nOh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear. I feel terrible that I misjudged you. This is gonna be good for Jerry.\nFor everybody.\nFor everybody.\nI better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out. I will leave you two to your adventures.\nOh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism.\nGeez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --\nNot so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.\nOkay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark.\nOh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty.\nOh, geez.\nHe threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.\nOh, fuck.\nI've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -\nOh, man.\n- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -\nOh, man.\n- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -\nYou're gonna deny it.\n- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -\nOh.\n- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that \"Mulan\" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -\nWhat are you talking about?\n- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty.\nSzechuan?\nThat's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce.\nMcNuggets?\nI want that \"Mulan\" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty.\nWhat the hell?\nIf it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.\nWhat are you talking about, Rick?\nThat's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.\nWhat are you talking about?!\nSeason -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.\nWhat is that?!\nFor 97 more years, Morty!\nWhat are you talking about?!\nI want that McNugget sauce, Morty!\nI am Phoenixperson."
